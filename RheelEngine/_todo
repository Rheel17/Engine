implement a very simple UI system
	- UI components like
		- text
		- button
		- textfield
		- etc.
		-
		- custom
	- Nesting of components should be possible.

Implement lighting shader correctly
-> Find a way to more efficiently get lights to the shader (uniform buffer objects?)

Add anti-aliazing effects

Custom shaders? Let the user specify the main function, other functions, uniforms, but not
	'in'/'out' for vertex/fragment. Have some pre-defined uniforms that	the default 
	modelshader also uses. 

IMPORTANT: VERSION CONTROL!!!
